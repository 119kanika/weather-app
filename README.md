# Weather App
- Know the weather of your location with other weather details like maximum/minimum temperature or humidity.
- This web app is fully responsive and is compatible with both desktop and mobile.
- I used React, redux, Tailwind CSS and JavaScript for building this web app.
- Integrated OpenWeatherAPI for gathering weather information of different cities.



## Setup
1. Clone or download this repository on your local machine.
2. Install npm packages 
```bash
  npm install 
```
3. If somehow the app is not able to fetch the data or shows wrong API key, then you may use *OpenWeather API key: 834587ca6fb8f3fffe83b93dafd88ad4*  
4. Run the application
```bash
  npm run dev 
```
